  <h1>Responsivity Completed</h1>
  <h4>Written by: SecretCode<br>Created on: 16/09/2022</h4>
  <p>It is finally done. I have finally managed to make this entire page responsive! Hopefully, you're able to see this website in a very cool way, whether it's in phone, tablet or computer! You would see many changes to everything if you've been here since the beginning! It is much better now.<br>I hope that you'd enjoy reading and looking through my website. This is a huge passion project for me, to just have a place to speak my mind and to deal out all of my stuff. I hope you all enjoy. If you don't, it's fine, because I do :)</p>
