  <h1>Update Time</h1>
  <h4>Written by: SecretCode<br>Created on: 07/09/2022</h4>
  <p>It's time to update the website! I'm trying to make it responsive, but it's not working sadly. If anyone here knows how to make it responsive, drop me a DM! If not, I'll try to figure it out! Work has been really tough, and making an ARG on the side is a little more work. However, I am determined to do this! Anyways, I just wanted to drop a small update on my life! And here's a new puzzle! DM me if you solve it!</p>
